The Plugin Loader's goal is to be able to load and unload plugins from memory, allowing different systems to be pulled in at runtime and reloaded at runtime

The API should be easily extensible for different platforms as needed and should be able to load dlls by key

The majority of the API should be abstracted from the use of the filesystem, maybe using directory strings such as Test/DllName would look in Test for DllName
Which has the format Child/Child/.../DllName.

Example usage:

{
	Plugin loadedPlugin = Plugin::Load("ActiveDirectory");

	// Possible uses:
	PluginAPI<void> call = loadedPlugin.GetAPI<voi>("Callback");
	void(*otherCall)() = loadedPlugin.GetAPI<voi>("Callback");

	// I'd also like to be able to load a dll from raw data, I'll probablt have to expand the LoadLibrary macro

	Plugin::Unload(loadedPlugin);

	Plugin fromDataPlugin = Plugin::Load(someData);
}


This would require the
